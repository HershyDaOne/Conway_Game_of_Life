This is the game created by John Horton Conway in 1970. Its is a zero player game. That means once you input the arguments, the game functions without human interferance. the following rules are:
1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
There are also many different patterns and shapes such as gliders and blinkers.
To use this code, there is a menu where you can input single cells and the two shapes stated above. 
You can use the single cells to make your own custom shapes.
In order to see each generation, you have to keep pressing the 'enter button'.
The grid is a 20x20 but can easily be modified by replacing the value of the nested loops.
This game is written in such a way that it avoids complex stuff and uses the simplest code to promote understanding for beginning coders.
This code was written by one person and no AI tools.
Enjoy the game but try to make it on your own before looking at the code.
